# Challenge 00 - Getting familiar

## Situation

This Challenge is intended to set out the structure for all the challenges going forward.

Each challenge is populated with a 'briefing' document (this one), a `challenge.py` script and a template `my_solution.py` script.

***Do not*** modify the `challenge.py` script as this file contains the code that both generates versions of the challenge for you to attempt, and also checks your answers.

The `my_solution.py` document contains a blank template for you to start with. Some Challenges *may* contain additional resources or guidance.

This challenge also contains an `example_solution.py` to demonstrate the usage of the `Challenge` Class and the method `check_solution()`.

## Mission

In this challenge, you will be expected to:

- Learn how to use the `Challenge` class to create instances of challenges.
- Access properties to help solve a simple puzzle.
- Use the instance's method to check your solution.

## Execution

1. Write code that will make and instance of the `Challenge` class.

2. Print this instance's `.data` property to the terminal.

3. Use the information obtained from the `.data` property to modify the `.solution` property.

4. Use the `.check_solution()` method to check your answer. (`True` if correct, otherwise `False`)

## Conclusion

Give it a go, and get in touch if you encounter any issues.

I'd recommend using Jupyter/ipynb for working through some of these problems.

You can also do some forensics on the `challenge.py` script if you get really stuck - often, in order to check a given answer, I have to find it myself, so if you can decipher my code, you've earnt the win!
