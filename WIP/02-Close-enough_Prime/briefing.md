# Close-enough Prime

## Situation

A prime number is any number that is ***only*** divisible by itself and 1.

Some popular examples include:

`2` | `3` | `7` | `13` | `41` | `101` | `19,999,999`

## Mission

Your task is to create a program that will find the closest prime to any given number.

If the number given is a prime itself, then that number is the solution.

If there are 2 numbers equally far away, the solution is both numbers.

## Execution

1. Create a new Challenge instance.
2. Access the `.data` attribute which will contain the number you are to check.
3. Find the closest prime numbers.
4. Check the solution using the `.check_solution` method.

## Conclusion

This challenge may introduce some interesting performance considerations
